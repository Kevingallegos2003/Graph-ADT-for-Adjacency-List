The FindPath program
FindPath.c  | Uses the Graph ADT (Graph.h) to print an adjacency matrix into an output file
Graph.c     | Creates adjacency matrix and uses BFS
Graph.h     | Prototypes of functions that will be used in Graph.c
List.c      | All Functions created from the prototypes in List.h
GraphTest.c | Testing file used to test functions from Graph.c all tests are outputed on the line
List.h      | Prototypes of functions that will be used in the findpath program
Makefile    | Compiles and Makes the FindPath program as well as other testing code optionally
| Note: Althouigh structs seem to give desired variables in Graph.c they spit out nonsense when they should be assigned their proper variables
